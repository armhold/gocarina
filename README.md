# GOCARINA - simple Optical Character Recognition in Go

Gocarina uses a neural network to do simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
It's trained on [Letterpress(™)](http://www.atebits.com/letterpress) game boards.

This is a Go port of the [Ruby project](https://github.com/armhold/ocarina) I did a few years back.

## Usage

First, install the software:

`$ go get github.com/armhold/gocarina/...`

Next, we need to create and train a network. Be sure to first connect to the source directory
(`train` expects the game boards to appear in `board-images/`):

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/armhold/gocarina
$ train
```

You now have a trained neural network in `ocr.save`. You can ask it decipher game boards like this:

`$ recognize board-images/board3.png`
```
 L H F L M
 R V P U K
 V O E E X
 I N R I T
 V N S I Q
```

You can also ask it to give you a list of words that can be formed with the board:

`$ recognize -w board-images/board3.png`
```
 L H F L M
 R V P U K
 V O E E X
 I N R I T
 V N S I Q


overmultiplies
relinquishment
feuilletonism
fluorimetries
interinvolves
pluviometries
reptiliferous
[etc...]
```


Caveat: this software expects game boards to be 640x1136 pixels, as that is the size generated by my phone.
Your mobile device may use a different board size, based on its screen. Gocarina automatically scales the boards
to the expected size, but I haven't actually tried it. You might have more success in adjusting the values like
`LetterPressExpectedWidth` than with scaling.


## How it works

We start with three "known" game boards. We split them up into individual tiles, one per letter.
This covers the entire alphabet, and gives us our training set. We feed the tiles into the network one at a time,
and calculate the error value for expected vs the actual result. We do this repeatedly, until the network
is trained (typically requires < 100 iterations).


## Representation & Encoding

The tiles are quantized to black & white, bounding boxed, and finally scaled down to a small rectangular bitmap.
These bits are then fed directly into the inputs of the network.

We use a bit string to represent a given letter. 8 bits allows us to represent 256 different characters, which is
more than sufficient to cover the 26 characters used in Letterpress (we could certainly get away with using only
5 bits, but I wanted to hold the door open for potentially doing more than just Letterpress).

For convenience, we use the natural ASCII/Unicode mapping where 'A' = 65, aka 01000001. So our network has 8
outputs, corresponding to the 8 bits of our letters.


## Can I use this as a production-ready OCR package?

Doubtful. This is a more or less a toy implementation of OCR that operates on a very restricted set of input.
It was created by an AI-hobbyist, for fun and educational purposes. However there's nothing stopping you from
using this to learn from, and perhaps you can build something more substantial based on it.


## What's with the name?

Original project: "Ocarina", **OC**a**R**ina, i.e. OCR. Go + Ocarina => Gocarina.
